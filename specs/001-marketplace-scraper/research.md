# Research Findings: Marketplace Scraper Scripts

**Date**: 2025-12-23
**Feature**: Marketplace Scraper Scripts
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

Research phase completed. All technical decisions were already resolved during the clarify phase and initial implementation. The implementation adopts the marketplace.json approach from code-assistant-manager for fetching plugin data from GitHub repositories.

## Technical Decisions Made

### Plugin Fetching Architecture
**Decision**: Adopt `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` approach from code-assistant-manager
**Rationale**: This provides structured plugin metadata, better organization, and aligns with existing marketplace patterns
**Alternatives Considered**: Individual manifest files per plugin (rejected due to fragmentation and inconsistent naming)

### Data Display Format
**Decision**: Table format for plugins with Plugin, Description, Author, Version columns
**Rationale**: Better scannability and organization compared to bullet lists, follows standard curated list patterns
**Alternatives Considered**: Bullet lists (rejected for poor readability with large datasets)

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with comprehensive logging
**Rationale**: Network-dependent tool must handle failures without breaking entire process
**Alternatives Considered**: Strict failure modes (rejected due to unreliable network dependencies)

## Implementation Patterns Adopted

### From code-assistant-manager:
- GitHub raw file fetching with retry logic
- Branch fallback (main → master → develop)
- marketplace.json validation and parsing
- Plugin metadata structure and field mapping

### Performance Optimizations:
- HTTP session reuse for connection pooling
- JSON validation before processing
- Early termination on invalid data structures

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: All major technical decisions resolved
**Low Risk**: Implementation already prototyped and tested
**Low Risk**: Dependencies are well-established Python libraries
**Medium Risk**: Network dependency requires robust error handling (addressed)

## Next Steps

Proceed to Phase 1: Design contracts and data models based on established technical approach.</content>
