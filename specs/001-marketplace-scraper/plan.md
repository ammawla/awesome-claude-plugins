# Implementation Plan: Marketplace Scraper Scripts

**Branch**: `001-marketplace-scraper` | **Date**: 2025-12-23 | **Spec**: specs/001-marketplace-scraper/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-marketplace-scraper/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a Python CLI tool that fetches Claude marketplace and plugin data from configured sources (primarily GitHub repositories) and generates a curated README.md with organized tables of marketplaces and categorized plugins. The tool adopts the marketplace.json approach from code-assistant-manager for fetching plugin data and displays plugins in table format.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.8+ (already implemented and tested)
**Primary Dependencies**: requests (HTTP fetching), PyYAML (config parsing), jinja2 (templating), markdown (validation), urllib3 (robust HTTP)
**Storage**: File-based (config.yaml input, README.md output, no database required)
**Testing**: pytest (already implemented with unit and integration tests)
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS cross-platform (Python CLI application)
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI script with modular components)
**Performance Goals**: Complete execution in under 5 minutes for up to 10 sources
**Constraints**: Network-dependent with graceful error handling, must handle 10k+ plugins efficiently
**Scale/Scope**: Process 12+ marketplaces containing 600+ plugins from multiple GitHub sources

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Constitution Principles Compliance:**

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Implementation fetches from multiple marketplace sources including official and community repositories, ensuring broad coverage of available Claude plugins.

✅ **Quality Assurance**: Tool validates marketplace.json structure, handles malformed data gracefully, and only includes plugins with proper metadata (name, description, category).

✅ **Community Driven**: Generated README encourages contributions and provides clear structure for community maintenance of the plugin list.

✅ **Regular Maintenance**: Script enables automated updates of the curated list by fetching current data from live marketplace repositories.

✅ **Clear Organization**: Plugins are organized by marketplace and category with table-based display for easy navigation and discovery.

**Gates Status**: ✅ ALL PASSED - Implementation aligns with all constitution principles.

**Post-Phase 1 Re-evaluation**: ✅ ALL PASSED - Design artifacts (data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md) successfully created and align with constitution principles.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with modular components organized by function (CLI, models, utils, generators). Tests follow standard pytest structure with unit and integration separation. Configuration files remain in repository root for easy access.

## Phase 1 Completion Summary

**✅ Research Phase**: Completed - All technical decisions resolved through clarify phase and implementation analysis. Adopted marketplace.json approach from code-assistant-manager.

**✅ Design Phase**: Completed - Created comprehensive design artifacts:
- `data-model.md`: Defined Marketplace, Plugin, and Source entities with relationships and validation rules
- `contracts/cli-contract.md`: Specified CLI command contracts with input/output schemas and error handling
- `quickstart.md`: Created user-friendly quick start guide with examples and troubleshooting

**✅ Constitution Compliance**: ✅ PASSED - Both pre-research and post-design checks confirm alignment with all constitution principles.

**✅ Agent Context**: Updated - Added marketplace scraper technologies to Claude Code context.

## Next Steps

**Phase 2**: Ready for `/speckit.tasks` command to generate detailed implementation tasks based on this plan.

**Phase 3**: Implementation following generated tasks with marketplace.json fetching and table-based plugin display.

**Ready for Development**: All design artifacts complete and approved. Implementation can proceed with clear technical direction and validated approach.
